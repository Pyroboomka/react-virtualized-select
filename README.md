###Info

This is my fork for personal usage, since fixing a bug requires a wrapper around react-select.

React 16.2+ because portals, wow.

Basically, it takes solutions from [here](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/810) and messes a bit with imports.

All credits goes to [author](http://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized-select/) and guy who actually wrote code. (@kamagatos)
